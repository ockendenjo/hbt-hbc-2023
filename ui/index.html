        <h1>Instructions</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Get into a pair/team. Scoring is per team rather than individual.
          </li>
          <li>
            You get points for visiting each stash. The number of points is
            stated on the icon.
          </li>
          <li>Stashes cannot be visited by the same team more than once.</li>
          <li>
            Keep track of your teamâ€™s score - this can be done on the app by
            selecting 'visited' on the drop-down menu. You can also keep track
            of your bonus points this way! Your score will be shown in the top
            right corner.
          </li>
          <li>
            If something in the stash has further instructions, you must follow
            them.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are limited supplies at each stash, so you may arrive to find
            nothing left. Get in there quickly!
          </li>
          <li>
            You must be back at Bellfield Brewery by 20:30. You lose a point for
            every minute you are late.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Bonus points</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>
            2 points for each beverage drunk at the stop (max 1 beverage per
            person).
          </li>
          <li>
            Beverages must be drunk on location, but confectionary can be taken
            away.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Map notes</h1>

        <p>Blue circle - start/finish locations</p>
        <p>Green - you've marked it as visited</p>
