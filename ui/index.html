                <h1>Instructions</h1>

                <ul>
                    <li>Get into a pair. Scoring is per team rather than individual.</li>
                    <li>You get points for visiting each stash. The number of points is stated on the icon.</li>
                    <li>Stashes cannot be visited by the same team more than once.</li>
                    <li>
                        Keep track of your teamâ€™s score - this can be done on the app by selecting 'visited' on the
                        drop-down menu. You can also keep track of your bonus points this way! Your score will be shown
                        in the top right corner.
                    </li>
                    <li>If something in the stash has further instructions, you must follow them.</li>
                    <li>
                        There are limited supplies at each stash, so you may arrive to find nothing left. Get in there
                        quickly!
                    </li>
                    <li>You must be back at the Auld Hoose by 6pm. You lose a point for every minute you are late.</li>
                    <li>
                        If you are only joining for some of it, just count your score for that portion and send it over
                        to me.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Bonus points</h1>

                <ul>
                    <li>2 points for each person drinking a beverage at the stop.</li>
                    <li>1 point for each person taking a sweet/item of confectionary at the stop.</li>
                    <li>Beverages must be drunk on location, but confectionary can be taken away.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Map notes</h1>
                <p>Bat - normal stash</p>
                <p>Pumpkin - house or flat</p>
                <p>Orange - may have micro-trot friendly treats (if any left)</p>
                <p>Brown - trotter treats (if any left)</p>
                <p>Green - you've marked it as visited</p>
